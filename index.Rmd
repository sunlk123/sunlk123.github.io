My name is Lorraine Kwok and I am a second-year MPH student in the Department of Population and Family Health with a certificate in Public Health Research Methods. This semester, I am taking Data Science to learn more about data cleaning and data visualization. In addition to Data Science, I am taking Analysis of Categorical Data, Applied Linear Regression, Qualitative Data Analysis and Public Health GIS.
